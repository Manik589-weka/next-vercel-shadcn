This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

### Required: Environment variables on Vercel

For the build and the blog/Studio to work, set these in **Vercel → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables** (for Production, Preview, and Development):

| Name | Value | Notes |
|------|--------|------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` | Your Sanity project ID (e.g. `ult5g8gw`) | Required for build and runtime |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET` | Your dataset name (e.g. `dev` or `production`) | Required for build and runtime |
| `SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN` | Your Sanity API token (optional) | Only if you use draft/preview; keep secret |

Copy from your local `.env.local` or use `.env.example` as a template. **Redeploy** after saving the variables.
